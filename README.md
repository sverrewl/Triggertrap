# Triggertrap Source Code

Triggertrap is an open-source camera triggering platform based on Arduino. 

It comes in two versions: Triggertrap v1 (TTv1), which is a device aimed at consumers; and Triggertrap Shield for Arduino (TT-k) which is aimed at advanced users, hackers, and geeks (like us!). 

The codebase you are looking at is for both the above devices. 

_NOTE_ - there *are* differences between the TTv1 and TT-k. By default, the code ships for the Triggertrap Shield for Arduino (TT-k), because we anticipate that most people downloading and using this code will be using the Triggertrap Shield. If you wish to compile and install this code on your TTv1 device, remember to go into TTConfig.h, and read the section *Choose your version of the Triggertrap*. 

## Triggertrap v1 (TTv1)

The Triggertrap v1 is a battery-powered device with several sensors built-in:

* Laser sensor
* Ambient Light sensor
* Sound sensor

It also has a fully configurable AUX port, in the shape of a RCA socket, designed to accept additional external inputs and sensors. 

_Form Factor_ - The Triggertrap v1 comes in a perspex casing, and uses touch-sensitive buttons for control and operation. 

## Triggertrap Shield for Arduino (TT-k)

The Triggertrap Shield for Arduino is an Arduino-powered device with several sensors built-in:

* Laser sensor
* Ambient Light sensor
* Sound sensor

It also has a fully configurable AUX port, in the shape of a RCA socket, designed to accept additional external inputs and sensors. 

_Form Factor_ - The Triggertrap Shield for Arduino is an Arduino shield, and uses physical buttons for its interface.

# Changenotes

## 0.3.361 (10 August 2013)

* Enhancement: from setting you add 1350 milliseconds to shutter, makiing HDR possible on at least cannon.
* Enhancement: 15 second keypress on startbutton resets the settings,  but,  it is not easy to see - added 500 millisecond delay on message.

## 0.3.36 (6 March 2013)
* Bugfix: IR signal overflow fix for Nikon cameras when using shield only.
* Bugfix: Adjustment to IR timings for Sony cameras.
* Enhancement: Integration of Timelapse modifications from Duane Cassone. 

## 0.3.35 (16 July 2012)

* Bugfix: Fixes a tiny bug where the screen contrast (menu option added in 0.3.35) wasn't saved to EEPROM properly. 
* Bugfix: Elegant little hack that reads the LCD contrast setting twice, discarding the first reading, ensuring that the readings are accurate, especially when Triggertrap wakes from sleep. 
* Tagging with 0.3.35

## 0.3.34 (9 July 2012)

* Formally introduces Bulb Ramping into the Triggertrap Firmware
* Adds a menu item for adjusting your screen contrast for TTv1 (System -> Contrast)
* Bugfix: Fixes sleep problem introduced in 0.3.33b
* Tidies up code in TriggerTrap.cpp for easier hackability & readability

## 0.3.33b (18 June 2012)

* Introduces the Bulb Ramping feature
* Breaks several other features ;) (that is why this version was only ever a beta...)

## 0.3.32 (23 March 2012)

* Fixes a bug in the production Triggertrap where the laser sensor was too sensitive
* Fixes a bug in the production Triggertrap where the LCD display came up way too dark
* Adds additional documentation licence information that was missed out in the initial release
* Removes accidentally included .DS_Store files

## 0.3.31 (21 March 2012)

First open-source release of the Triggertrap codebase.
